I'll be traveling to the Philippines over the next two weeks. My original plan was to spend August and September 2015 in Thailand at a co-working spot in Ko Lanta, reading, wrapping up some projects, and doing a lot of self-reflection after wrapping up my nursing career. 

Well after the terrorist bombings in Bangkok, I decided to cancel the Thailand trip and head to the Philippines instead. I'll be spending a week in El Nido and Coron, Palawan, as well as a few nights in Metro Manila. 

My Ruby based goals during the trip include:

1. Attend the PhRUG meet up!
2. Re-read POODR
3. Finish reading Design Patterns in Ruby
4. Start reading Eloquent Ruby
5. Finish a few assignments from some jobs I've applied to
6. Blog, blog, blog!

In the midst of all that - my only other goal is to get some snorkeling time in, eat some fresh seafood, eat any and all types of street food, and relax.
