<p>I'm a software developer based in Washington DC. I'm also a registered nurse turned developer who is passionate about solving healthcare's problems via software. This site features articles regarding coding, nursing, and startups - also occasional essays on topics I'm interested in, which could pretty much be anything.

<h3>Can I hire you?</h3>
<p>Currently, I am not actively looking for new opportunities. But, if I were, I'd say that I have extensive experience working with and founding startups, meeting tight deadlines, fast iteration sprints, and optimizing for the bottom line. I'm the founder of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.meetup.com/Alexandria-Code-Coffee/">Alexandria Code & Coffee</a> where developers reach out and mentor new developers.</p> 

<p>I love software, computers, startups and technology! In general, I am very curious and like to know how things tick and work. I learn best when I'm neck deep in new technology, stretching the boundaries of my knowledge. When I can, I prefer working with my favorite frameworks, tools, languages & stack of choice:</p>

* Ruby
* Rails
* PostgreSQL
* Github
* Minitest
* RSpec
* AWS/S3
* HTML/CSS/Saas
* Redis
* Sidekiq
* Vim/Tmux/NERDtree

<p>I am an ardent proponent of TDD, SRP, micro services, object oriented and domain driven design. I enjoy design patterns and would love nothing more than to work with properly utilized abstractions ~ keyword, properly.</p>

<p>I strive to be a git commit perfectionist and work to elevate git standards on every team I work on.</p>

<p>My prized possession is a signed copy of Sandi Metz's POODR. One time I almost got into a car crash from being overly excited after listening to a programming podcast and realizing they were talking about one of my blog posts.</p>

<p>I like hefeweizens, despise stouts and enjoy the occasional injection of deadpan and sarcasm. Disclaimer: I am that geek in your office with a mechanical keyboard.</p>

<p>Overtime I've come to realize that being a good software engineer is as much about being able to communicate clearly as it is pounding out code. The former is oftentimes much more challenging.</p>
