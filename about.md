<p>I'm a Freelance Developer based in Washington DC. I'm also a registered nurse turned hacker/programmer who is passionate about solving healthcare's problems via software. This site features articles regarding coding, nursing, and startups - also occasional essays on topics I'm interested in, which could pretty much be anything.</p>

<h3>Not accepting new projects</h3>
<p>As I am currently looking for employment with the ideal company. I have extensive experience working with startups and meeting tight deadlines, fast iteration sprints, and optimizing for the bottom line. I'm the founder of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.meetup.com/Alexandria-Code-Coffee/">Alexandria Code & Coffee</a> where developers reach out and mentor new developers.</p> 

<p>I love software, computers, startups and technology! In general, I am very curious and like to know how things tick and work. I enjoy learning new technologies but when I can, I prefer working with my favorite frameworks, languages & stack of choice:</p>

* Ruby
* Ruby on Rails
* PostgreSQL
* Heroku
* Rspec
* jQuery
* Coffeescript
* Saas

<p>In my spare time I enjoy traveling, weight lifting, and I'm also a closet history buff. My best work would be something that merges my extensive clinical domain knowledge with my software development skills. Are you a healthcare startup? Contact me!</p>

<p>However, if you contact me for .NET opportunities, you can expect not to hear from me.</p>
