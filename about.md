<p>I'm a Freelance Developer based in Washington DC. I'm also a registered nurse turned hacker/programmer who is passionate about solving healthcare's problems via software. This site features articles regarding coding, nursing, and startups - also occasional essays on topics I'm interested in, which could pretty much be anything.</p>
